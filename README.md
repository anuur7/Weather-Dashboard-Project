# Weather-Dashboard-Project

● I made a header that has a h1, an input box and a btn also made a main section, an aside and the 5 day forecast boxes

● Then I declared variables for the classes and made an async function and used an API to fetch the data.

● Then I displayed the date, city, humidty, temp and wind on screen with innerHTML.

● Then I made async functions for the cities on the side list and displayed on screen when clicked.

● Then I added class of cities to html and put all the side list cities in one function rather than seperate functions

● Then I used an api to get the uv index and also displayed the icon using an iconURL.

● Finally I fetched the data for all the forecast containers and used innerhtml.
